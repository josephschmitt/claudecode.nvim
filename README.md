**The first Neovim IDE integration for Claude Code** ‚Äî bringing Anthropic's AI coding assistant to your favorite editor with a pure Lua implementation.

> üéØ **TL;DR:** When Anthropic released Claude Code with VS Code and JetBrains support, I reverse-engineered their extension and built this Neovim plugin. This plugin implements the same WebSocket-based MCP protocol, giving Neovim users the same AI-powered coding experience.

## What Makes This Special

When Anthropic released Claude Code, they only supported VS Code and JetBrains. As a Neovim user, I wanted the same experience ‚Äî so I reverse-engineered their extension and built this.

- üöÄ **Pure Lua, Zero Dependencies** ‚Äî Built entirely with `vim.loop` and Neovim built-ins
- üîå **100% Protocol Compatible** ‚Äî Same WebSocket MCP implementation as official extensions
- üéì **Fully Documented Protocol** ‚Äî Learn how to build your own integrations ([see PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md))
- ‚ö° **First to Market** ‚Äî Beat Anthropic to releasing Neovim support
- üõ†Ô∏è **Built with AI** ‚Äî Used Claude to reverse-engineer Claude's own protocol

## Quick Demo

```vim
" Launch Claude Code in a split
:ClaudeCode

" Claude now sees your current file and selections in real-time!

" Send visual selection as context
:'<,'>ClaudeCodeSend

" Claude can open files, show diffs, and more
```

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.8.0
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Optional: [folke/snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) for enhanced terminal support

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "coder/claudecode.nvim",
  config = true,
  keys = {
    { "<leader>a", nil, desc = "AI/Claude Code" },
    { "<leader>ac", "<cmd>ClaudeCode<cr>", desc = "Toggle Claude" },
    { "<leader>af", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeFocus<cr>", desc = "Focus Claude" },
    { "<leader>ar", "<cmd>ClaudeCode --resume<cr>", desc = "Resume Claude" },
    { "<leader>aC", "<cmd>ClaudeCode --continue<cr>", desc = "Continue Claude" },
    { "<leader>as", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeSend<cr>", mode = "v", desc = "Send to Claude" },
    {
      "<leader>as",
      "<cmd>ClaudeCodeTreeAdd<cr>",
      desc = "Add file",
      ft = { "NvimTree", "neo-tree", "oil" },
    },
    -- Diff management
    { "<leader>aa", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeDiffAccept<cr>", desc = "Accept diff" },
    { "<leader>ad", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeDiffDeny<cr>", desc = "Deny diff" },
  },
}
```

That's it! For more configuration options, see [Advanced Setup](#advanced-setup).

## Usage

1. **Launch Claude**: Run `:ClaudeCode` to open Claude in a split terminal
2. **Send context**:
   - Select text in visual mode and use `<leader>as` to send it to Claude
   - In `nvim-tree` or `neo-tree`, press `<leader>as` on a file to add it to Claude's context
3. **Let Claude work**: Claude can now:
   - See your current file and selections in real-time
   - Open files in your editor
   - Show diffs with proposed changes
   - Access diagnostics and workspace info

## Commands

- `:ClaudeCode [arguments]` - Toggle the Claude Code terminal window (simple show/hide behavior)
- `:ClaudeCodeFocus [arguments]` - Smart focus/toggle Claude terminal (switches to terminal if not focused, hides if focused)
- `:ClaudeCode --resume` - Resume a previous Claude conversation
- `:ClaudeCode --continue` - Continue Claude conversation
- `:ClaudeCodeSend` - Send current visual selection to Claude, or add files from tree explorer
- `:ClaudeCodeTreeAdd` - Add selected file(s) from tree explorer to Claude context (also available via ClaudeCodeSend)
- `:ClaudeCodeAdd <file-path> [start-line] [end-line]` - Add a specific file or directory to Claude context by path with optional line range
- `:ClaudeCodeDiffAccept` - Accept the current diff changes (equivalent to `<leader>aa`)
- `:ClaudeCodeDiffDeny` - Deny/reject the current diff changes (equivalent to `<leader>ad`)

### Toggle Behavior

- **`:ClaudeCode`** - Simple toggle: Always show/hide terminal regardless of current focus
- **`:ClaudeCodeFocus`** - Smart focus: Focus terminal if not active, hide if currently focused

### Tree Integration

The `<leader>as` keybinding has context-aware behavior:

- **In normal buffers (visual mode)**: Sends selected text to Claude
- **In nvim-tree/neo-tree/oil.nvim/snacks buffers**: Adds the file under cursor (or selected files) to Claude's context

This allows you to quickly add entire files to Claude's context for review, refactoring, or discussion.

#### Features

- **Single file**: Place cursor on any file and press `<leader>as`
- **Multiple files**: Select multiple files (using tree plugin's selection features or visual selection in oil.nvim) and press `<leader>as`
- **Smart detection**: Automatically detects whether you're in nvim-tree, neo-tree, oil.nvim, or snacks
- **Error handling**: Clear feedback if no files are selected or if tree plugins aren't available

### Direct File Addition

The `:ClaudeCodeAdd` command allows you to add files or directories directly by path, with optional line range specification:

```vim
:ClaudeCodeAdd src/main.lua
:ClaudeCodeAdd ~/projects/myproject/
:ClaudeCodeAdd ./README.md
:ClaudeCodeAdd src/main.lua 50 100    " Lines 50-100 only
:ClaudeCodeAdd config.lua 25          " Only line 25
```

#### Features

- **Path completion**: Tab completion for file and directory paths
- **Path expansion**: Supports `~` for home directory and relative paths
- **Line range support**: Optionally specify start and end lines for files (ignored for directories)
- **Validation**: Checks that files and directories exist before adding, validates line numbers
- **Flexible**: Works with both individual files and entire directories

## Working with Diffs

When Claude proposes changes to your files, the plugin opens a native Neovim diff view showing the original file alongside the proposed changes. You have several options to accept or reject these changes:

### Accepting Changes

- **`:w` (save)** - Accept the changes and apply them to your file
- **`<leader>aa`** - Accept the changes using the dedicated keymap (configured in LazyVim spec)

You can edit the proposed changes in the right-hand diff buffer before accepting them. This allows you to modify Claude's suggestions or make additional tweaks before applying the final version to your file.

Both methods signal Claude Code to apply the changes to your file, after which the plugin automatically reloads the affected buffers to show the updated content.

### Rejecting Changes

- **`:q` or `:close`** - Close the diff view to reject the changes
- **`<leader>ad`** - Reject changes using the dedicated keymap (configured in LazyVim spec)
- **`:bdelete` or `:bwipeout`** - Delete the diff buffer to reject changes

When you reject changes, the diff view closes and the original file remains unchanged.

### Accepting/Rejecting from Claude Code Terminal

You can also navigate to the Claude Code terminal window and accept or reject diffs directly from within Claude's interface. This provides an alternative way to manage diffs without using the Neovim-specific keymaps.

### Customizing Diff Keymaps

The diff keymaps are configured in the LazyVim spec and can be customized by modifying the `keys` table:

```lua
{
  "coder/claudecode.nvim",
  config = true,
  keys = {
    -- ... other keymaps ...

    -- Customize diff keymaps to avoid conflicts (e.g., with debugger)
    { "<leader>ya", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeDiffAccept<cr>", desc = "Accept diff" },
    { "<leader>yn", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeDiffDeny<cr>", desc = "Deny diff" },

    -- Or disable them entirely by omitting them from the keys table
  },
}
```

The commands `ClaudeCodeDiffAccept` and `ClaudeCodeDiffDeny` work only in diff buffers created by the plugin and will show a warning if used elsewhere.

### How It Works

The plugin uses a signal-based approach where accepting or rejecting a diff sends a message to Claude Code rather than directly modifying files. This ensures consistency and allows Claude Code to handle the actual file operations while the plugin manages the user interface and buffer reloading.

#### Examples

```vim
" Add entire files
:ClaudeCodeAdd src/components/Header.tsx
:ClaudeCodeAdd ~/.config/nvim/init.lua

" Add entire directories (line numbers ignored)
:ClaudeCodeAdd tests/
:ClaudeCodeAdd ../other-project/

" Add specific line ranges
:ClaudeCodeAdd src/main.lua 50 100        " Lines 50 through 100
:ClaudeCodeAdd config.lua 25              " Only line 25
:ClaudeCodeAdd utils.py 1 50              " First 50 lines
:ClaudeCodeAdd README.md 10 20            " Just lines 10-20

" Path expansion works with line ranges
:ClaudeCodeAdd ~/project/src/app.js 100 200
:ClaudeCodeAdd ./relative/path.lua 30
```

## How It Works

This plugin creates a WebSocket server that Claude Code CLI connects to, implementing the same protocol as the official VS Code extension. When you launch Claude, it automatically detects Neovim and gains full access to your editor.

### The Protocol

The extensions use a WebSocket-based variant of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that only Claude Code supports. The plugin:

1. Creates a WebSocket server on a random port
2. Writes a lock file to `~/.claude/ide/[port].lock` with connection info
3. Sets environment variables that tell Claude where to connect
4. Implements MCP tools that Claude can call

For the full technical details and protocol documentation, see [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md).

  },
  opts = {
    log_level = "debug",
    visual_demotion_delay_ms = 100,  -- Slower selection demotion
    connection_wait_delay = 500,     -- Longer delay for @ mention batching
    terminal = {
      split_side = "left",
      split_width_percentage = 0.4,  -- Wider terminal
      provider = "snacks",
      auto_close = false,            -- Keep terminal open to review output
    },
    diff_opts = {
      vertical_split = false,        -- Horizontal diffs
      open_in_current_tab = false,   -- New tabs for diffs
    },
  },
}
```

#### Custom Claude Installation

```lua
{
  "coder/claudecode.nvim",
  keys = {
    { "<leader>a", nil, desc = "AI/Claude Code" },
    { "<leader>ac", "<cmd>ClaudeCode<cr>", desc = "Toggle Claude" },
    { "<leader>af", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeFocus<cr>", desc = "Focus Claude" },
    { "<leader>ar", "<cmd>ClaudeCode --resume<cr>", desc = "Resume Claude" },
    { "<leader>aC", "<cmd>ClaudeCode --continue<cr>", desc = "Continue Claude" },
    { "<leader>as", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeSend<cr>", mode = "v", desc = "Send to Claude" },
    {
      "<leader>as",
      "<cmd>ClaudeCodeTreeAdd<cr>",
      desc = "Add file",
      ft = { "NvimTree", "neo-tree", "oil" },
    },
    -- Diff management
    { "<leader>aa", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeDiffAccept<cr>", desc = "Accept diff" },
    { "<leader>ad", "<cmd>ClaudeCodeDiffDeny<cr>", desc = "Deny diff" },
  },
  opts = {
    terminal_cmd = "/opt/claude/bin/claude",  -- Custom Claude path
    port_range = { min = 20000, max = 25000 }, -- Different port range
  },
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Claude not connecting?** Check `:ClaudeCodeStatus` and verify lock file exists in `~/.claude/ide/`
- **Need debug logs?** Set `log_level = "debug"` in setup
- **Terminal issues?** Try `provider = "native"` if using snacks.nvim
